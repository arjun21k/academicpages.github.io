Hello! I'm Arjun, a first year Ph.D. student in [CSE](https://cse.osu.edu/){:target="_blank"} at [The Ohio State University](https://www.osu.edu/){:target="_blank"}. My advisor is [Dr. Xiaoyi Lu](http://web.cse.ohio-state.edu/~lu.932/){:target="_blank"} and my research interests include Virtualization, Cloud Computing, and Storage.

During the summer of 2019, I interned at [Microsoft Research Lab - Cambridge](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/lab/microsoft-research-cambridge/){:target="_blank"} in the [Future of Work](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/theme/future-of-work/){:target="_blank"} team. In the summer of 2018, my internship was in the [Businees Applications Group](https://dynamics.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-power-platform/){:target="_blank"} at [Microsoft](https://www.microsoft.com/){:target="_blank"} in Redmond, Washington.
