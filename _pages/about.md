Hello! I'm Arjun, a second year masters student in [CS](https://www.cs.wisc.edu/){:target="_blank"} at [UW-Madison](https://www.wisc.edu/){:target="_blank"}. I am fortunate to be working with [Prof. Suman Banerjee](http://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~suman/){:target="_blank"}. My current research interests are in computer networks, security and systems.

Previously, I did my summer internship with the [Businees Applications Group](https://dynamics.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-power-platform/){:target="_blank"} at [Microsoft](https://www.microsoft.com/){:target="_blank"} in Redmond, Washington. Before that, I was a senior software developer at [Oracle](https://www.oracle.com/index.html){:target="_blank"} in Hyderabad, India. I completed my undergraduate in [Instrumentation & Control](https://www.nitt.edu/home/academics/departments/ice/){:target="_blank"} at [NIT Trichy](https://www.nitt.edu/){:target="_blank"}.
