Hello! I'm Arjun, a first year Ph.D. student in [CS](https://cse.osu.edu/){:target="_blank"} at [The Ohio State University](https://www.osu.edu/){:target="_blank"}. My research interests include High Performance Interconnects and Protocols,  Parallel Computing(MPI/PGAS), Virtualization, and Cloud Computing.

During the summer of 2019, I interned at [Microsoft Research Lab - Cambridge](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/lab/microsoft-research-cambridge/){:target="_blank"} in the [Future of Work](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/theme/future-of-work/){:target="_blank"} team. In the summer of 2018, my internship was in the [Businees Applications Group](https://dynamics.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-power-platform/){:target="_blank"} at [Microsoft](https://www.microsoft.com/){:target="_blank"} in Redmond, Washington. Before moving to the US, I was a senior software developer at [Oracle](https://www.oracle.com/index.html){:target="_blank"} in Hyderabad, India. I completed my undergraduate in [Instrumentation & Control](https://www.nitt.edu/home/academics/departments/ice/){:target="_blank"} at [NIT Trichy](https://www.nitt.edu/){:target="_blank"}.
