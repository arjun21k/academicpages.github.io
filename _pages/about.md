About me
======
Hello! I'm Arjun, a second year masters student in [CS](https://www.cs.wisc.edu/) at [UW-Madison](https://www.wisc.edu/). I am fortunate to be working with [Prof. Suman Banerjee](http://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~suman/). My current research interests are in computer networks, security and systems.

Previously, I did my summer internship with the [Businees Applications Group](https://dynamics.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-power-platform/) at [Microsoft](https://www.microsoft.com/) in Redmond, Washington. Before that, I was a senior software developer at [Oracle](https://www.oracle.com/index.html) in Hyderabad, India. I completed my undergraduate in [Electronics & Instrumentation](https://www.nitt.edu/home/academics/departments/ice/) at [NIT Trichy](https://www.nitt.edu/).
