Hello! I'm Arjun, a second year Ph.D. student in the Computer Science department at University of California, Merced. My advisor is Prof. [Xiaoyi Lu](https://sites.ucmerced.edu/luxi){:target="_blank"} and my research interests include Virtualization, Cloud Computing, and Storage. Previously (2019-2020), I was a Ph.D. student at the Ohio State University (OSU). The current projects that I am part of are on storage disaggregation and persistent memory.
