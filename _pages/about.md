Hello! I'm Arjun, a second year Ph.D. student in the Computer Science department at The Ohio State University. My advisor is [Xiaoyi Lu](http://web.cse.ohio-state.edu/~lu.932/){:target="_blank"} and my research interests include Virtualization, Cloud Computing, and Storage. The current projects that I am part of are on storage disaggregation and persistent memory.
